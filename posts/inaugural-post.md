Welcome to my blog.

My aspirations are to write about my learnings in software development, in particular, more about functional programming.
This will be the place where I will be recording my thougths and discoveries of my day to day. As devil is the details, I hope my writing will allow to provide more detailed explanations about the concepts I am learning, so I can refer to them in the future.
By taking the time to write about my learnings, I hope it will help me to better understand them.
I also hope this content can be helpful to others.
Lastly, I have no expectations on how frequent I will provide new content.

If you have any questions or comments, you can find me on twitter.
